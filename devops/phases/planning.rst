Planning
========

Prologue
--------

Planning. For some this is a daily activity, and for some like myself, its better
to not think about it, but lets face it. Planning is necessary to do much of
anything properly. There will be some of you out there that will fight me
tooth and nail on that point, and i used to as well, but since my experience with
`OpenFRC <https://github.com/OpenFRC>`_, I have learned that it is in fact one of
if not the ***most*** important steps in the design process.

Planning isn't just what is conventionally thought of as "planning". It isn't just
sitting in a room, listing ways to do something, and eventually deciding on one way
to solve a problem. It is much more than that. It involves drawing out state diagrams,
UML Layouts, as well as many more specific cases. If you are designing an App,
you need to plan how the screens will flow, what they will look like, and much more.
Without this knowledge ahead of time, things can quickly go off the rails.

One of the primary goals of DevOps is to prevent such cataclysms from  occurring,
especially so soon after starting a new project.
